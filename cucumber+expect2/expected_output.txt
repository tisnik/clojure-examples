You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:

(Given #"^The function factorial is callable$" []
  (comment  Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions  )
  (throw (cucumber.api.PendingException.)))

(When #"^I try to compute (\d+)!$" [arg1]
  (comment  Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions  )
  (throw (cucumber.api.PendingException.)))

(Then #"^I should get result (\d+)$" [arg1]
  (comment  Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions  )
  (throw (cucumber.api.PendingException.)))

(When #"^I try to compute -(\d+)!$" [arg1]
  (comment  Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions  )
  (throw (cucumber.api.PendingException.)))

(Then #"^the IllegalArgumentException should be thrown$" []
  (comment  Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions  )
  (throw (cucumber.api.PendingException.)))
